# Contributing

Floem aims to be a high performance UI library. New contributions are always welcome!

The best way to start contributing to Floem is to learn how it works by looking at the examples. If you think there are more examples that can be added, feel free to send in a PR!

Alternatively, you can have a look at issues to see if there is anything you'd like to pick up. 

Filing bugs with clear, reproducible steps is a great way to contribute as well.

It's not a good library if there isn't good documentation. So, all contributions to the documentation are very appreciated!

If you would like a conversation with the developers of Floem, you can join in the #floem channel on this [Discord](https://discord.gg/RB6cRYerXX).
