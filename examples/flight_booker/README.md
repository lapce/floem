# Flight Booker

This is an example that emulates an application that books flights, as
described in [task 3][task3] of [7gui tasks][7gui].

> The focus of Flight Booker lies on modelling constraints between
> widgets on the one hand and modelling constraints within a widget
> on the other hand. Such constraints are very common in everyday
> interactions with GUI applications. A good solution for Flight Booker
> will make the constraints clear, succinct and explicit in the source
> code and not hidden behind a lot of scaffolding.
