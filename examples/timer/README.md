# Timer

This is an example timer app, as described in
[task 4][task4] of [7gui tasks][7gui].

> Timer deals with concurrency in the sense that a timer process
> that updates the elapsed time runs concurrently to the userâ€™s
> interactions with the GUI application. This also means that the
> solution to competing user and signal interactions is tested. The
> fact that slider adjustments must be reflected immediately moreover
> tests the responsiveness of the solution. A good solution will make
> it clear that the signal is a timer tick and, as always, has not
> much scaffolding.
